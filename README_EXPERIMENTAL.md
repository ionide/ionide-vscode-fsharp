# Notes

This is the experimental version of Ionide plugin, used to test new features. Can be unstable.

For normal usage, please use the stable [Ionide-VSCode: FSharp](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/Ionide.Ionide-fsharp) extension instead.

# Requirements

* F# (Windows) - Easiest way to install latest versions of F# on Windows is using [VS Build Tools 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?utm_medium=microsoft&utm_source=docs.microsoft.com&utm_campaign=button+cta&utm_content=download+vs2017#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2017). If you use VS 2017, make sure that you've installed workload adding F# support.

* F# (Linux/MacOS) - F# on non-Windows platform is distributed as part of the `mono`. Installation guide and recent version of `mono` can be found on the [project webpage](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/) and on the F# Software Foundation ["Use on Linux" page](https://fsharp.org/use/linux/)

* .NET Core SDK - .NET Core is modern, cross-platform implementation of .NET Framework. Ionide is requiring it for set of features such as project modifications or debugging. The core part of SDK is `dotnet` CLI tool that provides easy way to create, build and run F# projects. What's important - the `dotnet` tool can be used also to create applications targeting also Full Framework (like `net461`). For detailed instructions on installing .NET Core, visit [official step-by-step installation guide](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core).

* VS Code C# plugin (optional) - Ionide's debugging capabilities relies on the debugger provided by Omnisharp team. To get it install [C# extension from VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp)

* MSBuild 2015 (Windows only, optional) - For old, verbose `.fsproj` files on Windows MSBuild 2015 (14.0) needs to be additionally installed. You can download it [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48159). However, we highly recommend using new, SDK-based project files.
