## Building

Everything is done via `build.cmd` \ `build.sh`.

- `build Build` does a full-build, including package installation and copying some necessary files.<br/>
  It should always be done at least once after any clone/pull.
- If a git dependency fail to build paket won't re-do it you can run their build scripts manually:
  - In `paket-files\github.com\fsharp\FsAutoComplete` run `build LocalRelease`
  - In `paket-files\github.com\fsharp-editing\Forge` run `build Build`
- In VSCode two configurations are possible to run:
  - Use `Build and Launch Extension`
  - Start the `Watch` task and when a build is done start `Launch Only`
