# How to contribute

## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code][vscode] ðŸ™„
- [Mono][mono]
- [.Net Core 2.0][dotnet]
- [Node.js][nodejs]
- [Yarn][yarn]

## Building

Fork, from the github interface https://github.com/ionide/ionide-vscode-fsharp
 - if you don't use a certificate for commiting to github:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USER/ionide-vscode-fsharp.git
```
 - if you use a certificate for github authentication:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USER/ionide-vscode-fsharp.git
```

### First time build:
```bash
cd ionide-vscode-fsharp
yarn install
dotnet restore
cd src
dotnet restore
cd ..
./build.sh  # or build.cmd if your OS is Windows
```

Everything is done via `build.cmd` \ `build.sh`.

- `build Build` does a full-build, including package installation and copying some necessary files.<br/>
  It should always be done at least once after any clone/pull.
- If a git dependency fail to build paket won't re-do it you can run their build scripts manually:
  - In `paket-files\github.com\fsharp\FsAutoComplete` run `build LocalRelease`
  - In `paket-files\github.com\fsharp-editing\Forge` run `build Build`
- In VSCode two configurations are possible to run:
  - Use `Build and Launch Extension`
  - Start the `Watch` task and when a build is done start `Launch Only`
