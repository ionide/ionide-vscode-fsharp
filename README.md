# Getting Started

F# 4.0 needs to be installed on your system in order to use Ionide

For more detailed instructions on installing F# :

* [Installing F# on Linux](http://fsharp.org/use/linux/)
* [Installing F# on OSX](http://fsharp.org/use/mac/)
* [Installing F# on Windows](http://fsharp.org/use/windows/)


**FSC** _(F# Compiler)_ and **FSI/fsharpi** on Mono _(F# Interactive)_ need to be added to your system **PATH**.
The default location on Windows is
```
  64-bit - C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\F#\4.0\Framework\v4.0\
  32-bit - C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\F#\4.0\Framework\v4.0
```

Add **MSBUILD_PATH** environment variable which points to the home of **Microsoft Build Tools**, e.g., `MSBUILD_PATH = C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\14.0\Bin`.

  ```json
// FSharp configuration
    // Set the verbosity for F# Language Service Output Channel
    "FSharp.logLanguageServiceRequestsOutputWindowLevel": "DEBUG",

    // Enable logging language service requests (FSAC)  to an output channel, the developer tools console, or both
    "FSharp.logLanguageServiceRequests": "both"
  ```
2. Open the Output Panel and switch to the `F# Language Service` Channel
3. Or Toggle Developer Tools (`Help |> Toggle Developer Tools`) and open the console tab

## How to contribute

*Imposter syndrome disclaimer*: I want your help. No really, I do.

There might be a little voice inside that tells you you're not ready; that you need to do one more tutorial, or learn another framework, or write a few more blog posts before you can help me with this project.

I assure you, that's not the case.

This project has some clear Contribution Guidelines and expectations that you can [read here](https://github.com/ionide/ionide-vscode-fsharp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

The contribution guidelines outline the process that you'll need to follow to get a patch merged. By making expectations and process explicit, I hope it will make it easier for you to contribute.

And you don't just have to write code. You can help out by writing documentation, tests, or even by giving feedback about this work. (And yes, that includes giving feedback about the contribution guidelines.)

Thank you for contributing!
