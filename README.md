# Getting Started

F# 4.0 needs to be installed on your system in order to use Ionide

For more detailed instructions on installing F# :

* [Installing F# on Linux](http://fsharp.org/use/linux/)
* [Installing F# on OSX](http://fsharp.org/use/mac/)
* [Installing F# on Windows](http://fsharp.org/use/windows/)


**FSC** _(F# Compiler)_ and **FSI/fsharpi** on Mono _(F# Interactive)_ need to be added to your system **PATH**.  
The default location on Windows is 
```
  64-bit - C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\F#\4.0\Framework\v4.0\
  32-bit - C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\F#\4.0\Framework\v4.0
```
## Quick Install Guide

### Windows

[You can download F# 4.0 here for Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48179)

[Install the Microsoft Build Tools 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48159&wa=wsignin1.0)

If you use [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), you can install all the pre-requisites easily:

```batch
choco install windows-sdk-8.0 -y
choco install visualfsharptools -y
choco install microsoft-build-tools -y
choco install visualstudiocode -y
```

### Mono

## WebPreview
`WebView` allows the user to override the default conventions used to run and preview web applications. To do so You need to create an `.ionide` file in the root folder of Your project opened by VSCode. The configuration file uses the [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) language.

Here is the default configuration values used if the `.ionide` file doesn't exist or some entry is missing:

```TOML
[WebPreview]
linuxPrefix = "mono"
command = "packages/FAKE/tools/FAKE.exe"
host = "localhost"
port = 8888
script = "build.fsx"
build = "Serve"
startString = "listener started"
parameters = []
startingPage = ""
```

* linuxPrefix - command used as prefix on Linux / Mac - usually `sh` or `mono`

* command - path to `FAKE.exe`

* host - address of webpage displayed in WebPreview - usually `localhost`

* port - port of webpage displayed in WebPreview (also passed to FAKE as environmental variable)

* script - FAKE build script passed to FAKE - usually `build.fsx`

* build - FAKE build target executed to start WebPreview

* startString - string which needs to be printed out in standard I/O to let know WebPreview to display webpage

* parameters - list of parameters passed to FAKE.exe

* startingPage - webpage displayed in WebPreview - usually ` ` or `index.html`
