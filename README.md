# Getting Started

F# 4.0 needs to be installed on your system in order to use Ionide

For more detailed instructions on installing F# :

* [Installing F# on Linux](http://fsharp.org/use/linux/)
* [Installing F# on OSX](http://fsharp.org/use/mac/)
* [Installing F# on Windows](http://fsharp.org/use/windows/)


**FSC** _(F# Compiler)_ and **FSI/fsharpi** on Mono _(F# Interactive)_ need to be added to your system **PATH**.
The default location on Windows is
```
  64-bit - C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\F#\4.0\Framework\v4.0\
  32-bit - C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\F#\4.0\Framework\v4.0
```

Add **MSBUILD_PATH** environment variable which points to the home of **Microsoft Build Tools**, e.g., `MSBUILD_PATH = D:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\14.0\Bin`.
